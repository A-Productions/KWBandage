Here are issues that are known that have not been fixed in this package

R17 Assimilator
 - Reaper 17 uses Scrin Assimilator instead of it's own. However in order to implement their own Assimilator, will need to find and edit every structure in the game.
 
Quad Turrets
 - Quad Turrets cause Desyncs in online multiplayer. A theory on the cause is the object is given a weapon after having none.
 - Bugged Animations
 - Want to refine models so only one is used between upgrades, especially SAM turrets (Still use different models depending on damage state)

Aircraft ammo Counter in unit portrait
 - Feature added in TW 1.05. Since KW was built before this version, this feature was not added in. Don't think it is possible to add back in

Space Command Uplink Effects
 - It is possible the devs intended to add a distortion effect but instead broke everything, removing the smoke. While the smoke has been fixed, the distortion has been removed.

EMP
 - EMP effects have the tendency to lag the game, most notable with EMP grenade probably due to overlap
 
Cultist
 - AI are not able to use mind control
 
Ravager
 - AI are not able to use Tiberium Agitation properly
 
Railgun Accelerator Heal
 - Objects affected by Railgun Accelerator when healed by repair drone or structure repair will no longer take penalty damage when still under the effect
