# KWBandage
 Compilation of files that aim to fix issues with Kanes Wrath including bug fixes, optimisation and balance consistency.
 These files are provided for convenient access and research purposes and is compatible with WrathEd modding tool.
 Related changes are documented in the game files
 
 To compile Low Level of Detail Files, you will need to use BuildPatch.bat and static_l_common.manifest provided in _Extras folder
 Place the BuildPatch.bat file in the same place as all the other Build batch files and static_l_common.manifest in WrathEd\Game Files\Manifest.
 This will patch the Low LOD static 1.2 files rather than create a low LOD patch of the mod (If that makes sense). Therefore the low LOD settings from the vanilla game is maintained.
  
 Credit is appreciated if you intend to re-use or repurpose the files
 
 Bug fixes are detailed in the PatchNotes.txt and any known issues that have not been fixed in this package are detailed in KnownIssues.txt
